Blood pressure measurement options:

	=> this might distract the wearer as the cuff inflates, or decrease blood flow to one of the arms





there is research about estimating blood with a camera on the fingertip [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00629-2] The fingertip is not an option as the musician obviously need their fingertips. It might however be an option to attach a small camera to the vessel of an arm. Precise location is needed though.

This paper also states that we could get the blood pressure from vessels in the face.

You can also measure the heartbeat from a phonodiagram. This is not an option since instrument will make to much noise literally.
'Acquiring SCG data from the chest

Unlike phonocardiography, seismocardiography (SCG) does not rely on the heart sound signal but on the vibrations caused by the cardiac cycle. These vibrations can be measured using a smartphoneâ€™s accelerometer. According to Wang et al.18, the SCG is preferable to the PCG signal, as it actually captures the opening of the heart valves and is thus a better reference for the ejection of blood into the artery.
=> an accelormeter on the heart/chest seems the best option. it has to be very precise. and their is the noise of the body movements ofcourse

found one, if not usable for me. it is usable for the other team: https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/lis3dh.html
=> low power, high resolution mode, I2C, SPI, ...
